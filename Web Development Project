<h1> The Best Places I've Eaten at<h1>
By: Zachary Brown</h1>
  <h3>Why do I enjoy food so much? </h3>
<p>For as long as I can remember I have been a huge foodie, usually being helped by Dad. Who let me have a variety of foods at a young age like raw oysters when I was four, and sushi when I was seven.
Thus, ever since a young age food has been a core part of who I am with a good meal being one of the most important things to me. On this Page I will be laying what I think are the best places I've ever eaten at.
I tried to make sure that the list is a diverse one, but I do have my own personal taste so some things might be missing </p>
